## Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security

Protecting and securing cloud-native applications requires significant changes in how we approach security: we need to think about security from the very first line of code, the very first container image build and the very first deployment.

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) keeps an eye on your OpenShift clusters in real time: it ensures applications are built, deployed and run securely by following customizable best-practises and industry standards. RHACS also protects your vital applications while they are running, bringing peace of mind.

The breakout will include a live demo where we will illustrate runtime security, and a complete DevSecOps pipeline secured by ACS.
